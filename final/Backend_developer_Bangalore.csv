Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve.

From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.

Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed\\-first company.


Responsibilities:

\\#WeAreCisco. We are all unique, but collectively we bring our talents to work as a team, to develop innovative technology and power a more inclusive, digital future for everyone. How do we do it? Well, for starters – with people like you!


Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data traveling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges, and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and sizes to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.


We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).


We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.


So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us! \\#WeAreCisco

In addition, unlike other generative AI offerings, Oracle’s generative AI services will not mix customer data. As a result, a given business’ competitive advantage will always remain its own. Tools for accessing data provenance and lineage will be available as well. **Powerful and impactful models:** Oracle’s generative AI services leverage Cohere’s pioneering foundational LLMs and can be customized and improved based on Oracle’s unique industry knowledge and data insights. In addition, customers can further refine these models using their own data to increase accuracy for specific business use cases. **Embedded generative AI services** : By making generative AI pervasive across its portfolio of cloud applications—including ERP, HCM, SCM, and CX—Oracle will enable customers to take advantage of the latest innovations within existing business processes. Oracle will deploy new models for Healthcare and Public Safety and embed generative AI throughout its industry\\-specific applications. These AI services will boost knowledge workers’ productivity and efficiency while freeing up time for play\\-test, creativity, and beneficial tasks and improving the overall employee experience. In addition, Oracle will embed generative AI capabilities into its database portfolio in the same way that it introduced machine learning features in Oracle Database and MySQL HeatWave. **Generative AI available wherever customers need it** : Customers can use the generative AI service in OCI and leverage all the advantages of public cloud to scale solutions on demand, customize models, and create private model endpoints for their business. In addition, Oracle will deliver generative AI services to organizations’ data centers, enabling them to combine generative capabilities together with their on\\-premises data and applications.  



**Your Opportunity:** 

As we innovate to provide a complete, end\\-to\\-end platform for generative AI, with advanced security, best\\-in\\-class data management, and a comprehensive portfolio of cloud applications able to address any business problem, we will be extremely happy to have you join us and share the very future of our Generative AI platform by building a cloud native Generative AI service. We are addressing exciting challenges at the intersection of generative artificial intelligence and innovative cloud infrastructure. Our product vision includes the ability for enterprises to be able to customize Generative AI services for their business and fine tune them to specialize in their data.  



Our vision is to provide a world\\-class Generative AI experience on Oracle Cloud.

We have 7\\.5 billion people on Earth, of which over 1 billion cannot securely prove their identity right now.
Every year, 140 million babies are born, of which 40 million go unregistered.
Simply put, these people are deprived of social benefits, such as education and health, their civil rights to vote and travel; and are excluded from the economy because they cannot sign up for bank accounts, loans, welfare programs etc. We believe this is unacceptable and needs to change.
At VIDA, We are creating a frictionless digital identity system. One that fulfills the needs and expectations of our times, and is available anywhere, for everyone.**Why are we solving this problem?**
The United Nations (UN) and World Bank ID4D initiatives aim to provide everyone on the planet with a legal identity by 2030\\. This deadline is just 9 years away, we are expecting a digital identity to be a legal human right by then and we at VIDA want to be pioneers in leading this change.**Who are we?**
We are a highly driven bunch of people to solve this problem for our own reasons. Whether it is to solve for misleading doctors, or because we didn’t get access to fair ration due to corruption \\- Our collective goal aligns. **Other things that we care about:*** Our mission is to enable trust, so what we do is pretty serious stuff – we work hard and we have audacious goals. We balance it through humor and making sure we have fun at work. We take our work seriously, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously.
* We are a startup so at times we will do things that are outside our scope. We do it to learn but we also do it because it takes a village.
* We believe feedback is a gift and should be given freely, constructively, and in a respectful manner.
* We are accountable to many stakeholders, but first and foremost, we are accountable to our mission and each other","","https://in.indeed.com/cmp/Vida-Digital-Identity","","","","","",""
