Postman's features simplify each step of building an API & streamline collaboration to help create better APIs‚Äîfaster. More than 35 million developers & 500,000 organizations worldwide use Postman today, and we continue to strive humbly towards our mission of 100 million connected developers & serving companies as they seek to innovate in an API-first world. Our customers are doing more and more astounding things with the Postman product every day, and as a result, we are growing rapidly.
We highly recommend reading The ""API-First World"" graphic novel to understand the bigger picture & our vision at Postman.
About the team & role:
The ‚ÄúAutomation Testing‚Äù team at Postman is responsible for a set of products designed to help users test their APIs, manually and otherwise. This means there are a wide range of problems to solve ‚Äì from a globally distributed system capable of executing hundreds of thousands of collections, to a browser-based client capable of running hours-long jobs, to CLI tools used to test production-grade APIs. The team primarily operates in an asynchronous manner, leveraging tools like Slack, Jira, and Confluence to stay on the same page. There is usually only one recurring meeting for the team every week, though team members can choose to work synchronously when appropriate.
Engineers on the team are encouraged to operate across the stack instead of siloing themselves into ‚Äúfrontend-only‚Äù or ‚Äúbackend-only‚Äù modes of operation. Folks do tend to specialize in whatever they find interesting, but are perfectly capable of building quality products by themselves as well. Everyone is expected to understand that, while part of the job is to write code, their actual responsibility is to build a great product and experience. This entails working hand-in-hand with everyone outside of Engineering, taking ownership of the product and experience as a whole.
Day-to-day work:

This is a hybrid role where you‚Äôre expected to work out of Postman‚Äôs Bangalore office three days a week ‚Äì Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The team is distributed across three timezones, however, and the working model is an asynchronous, remote-first model.

Folks have a fair amount of control over their work schedule and tend to start and end their days at different times. This also means that a rigid sprint/scrum/agile model with daily stand-ups doesn‚Äôt work well ‚Äì so we‚Äôve adopted a more flexible model. In simple terms, everyone starts their day with the next milestone in mind, gets a sense of what the rest of the team is aiming to achieve, and figures out what they can contribute.

There‚Äôs a lot of written work that happens ‚Äì engineering specifications, implementation documents, and, of course, pull requests. Most of the time in a day will likely be spent on technical design, discussion, and writing. Coding tends to be the fastest and easiest part, since it happens once everyone has a clear enough idea of what to write.

Part of the day goes towards engaging with users on platforms like Github or Discourse. This could be as simple as answering basic questions users might have, or addressing specific issues and pushing bug fixes. These interactions tend to inform the decisions we make as a team, so these are important!

While we engineer solutions to the best of our abilities, it‚Äôs inevitable that things go wrong once in a while. Participating in the on-call rotation is an important part of everyone‚Äôs role, and tends to take up 2 weeks every two months or so, with one week as the secondary on-call and another week as the primary.

About You:

At least 3 years of professional experience in the field. This is not an entry level role and you‚Äôre expected to have mastery over the basic operational aspects of software engineering, along with some exposure to building and maintaining production-grade products. There are no strict language or framework requirements, but you will have to get familiar with Javascript, React, Node.js, and adjacent tech to succeed in this role. Of course, you‚Äôll have a whole team helping you learn, so this shouldn‚Äôt be a huge concern.

Familiarity across the stack, or an enthusiastic attitude to fill in your knowledge gaps. The team is already capable of building great products without being siloed into ‚Äúfrontend‚Äù, ‚Äúbackend‚Äù, etc. roles, and the expectation remains the same for this role.

You have empathy for the end users and your teammates (living things in general, really). This reflects in how usable your product is, how you write your code, and how you work with others.","","","","","","","",""

About Us:

We're solving a problem that 62% of Americans have

62% of Americans last year thought about starting a business. The #1 reason they didn‚Äôt was because they didn‚Äôt know where to start. Currents options are:
‚Ä¢ Going independent which is risky: no support or direction
‚Ä¢ Paying a franchise which is expensive: franchises charge $100K+ fees to get started, take 10% of topline revenue, don't provide marketing support or technology

The market we're going after is bigger than e-Commerce

We‚Äôre disrupting the $2.3T franchise industry by removing the franchise fee and offering a tech-enabled franchise like product.

We‚Äôre starting with home painting where our biggest competitor is CertaPro a $550M revenue franchise (1% market share) before quickly taking on Neighborly Brands as we expand categories (pest control, lawn care, etc.).

As we expand categories, our customer does not change

Our customer is an aspiring business owner, like Nick or Hardin who doesn't care what type of business they start, as long as it is profitable. Our customers are not actually the one painting houses or completing roofing jobs, rather they are the one that hires people to do the job. Our customer has years of experience in sales and general management, which makes them suitable for any type of business ‚Äî which is why as we expand to 100 categories, our customer does not change.

Our solution is an end to end platform to help you start, grow and run a business

Main Street is a combination of well-known technology platforms that provides an Uber-like simple experience in starting a business
‚Ä¢ Stripe Atlas: Helping you incorporate and set up legal logistics for your business
‚Ä¢ Duolingo: Learn a new skill (in our case it is about a specific type of business)
‚Ä¢ Shopify: The operating tools to run your business
‚Ä¢ Womply: A marketing stack to drive your customer

We're backed by top investors and built a world-class team

We're a seed-stage startup and have raised $10M+ from top investors including Greylock and Khosla. Our team previously worked at places like DoorDash, OpenDoor, Amazon, and OYO.","","","","","","","",""

Sitetracker was founded ten years ago with the singular focus of solving a problem that was first recognized within the telecommunications industry; how to effectively manage the volume, variety, and velocity of critical infrastructure projects needed to meet the demand of expanding wireless and cellular service. That problem has become even more pronounced due to the eventual explosion of 5G. Being able to effectively deploy infrastructure is going to be the differentiator between leading telecommunication providers.

However, over the years, we realized that this challenge isn‚Äôt localized to telecommunications ‚Äì it‚Äôs pervasive nearly everywhere and has reached an inflection point. Utilities (such as gas and electric services), smart cities, and alternative energy all face similar challenges. Sitetracker is the only full\\-lifecycle project management platform suited to support these companies and address these challenges.

We are exceptionally proud of the company we‚Äôve built (we were recently recognized as the \\#2 place to work in San Francisco, as well as one of the top places to work in the entire United States). Our people are extraordinary and we‚Äôre continuing to invest in our people\\-first culture.","","https://in.indeed.com/cmp/Sitetracker","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/3cd59b0de818d90e47a19065a04cab78","http://www.sitetraker.com","Palo Alto","11 to 50","",""

==================



Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve.

Since 2012, we have built the market\\-leading cloud security company and an award\\-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, Taipei, and Tokyo.

**What you will be doing**


* Work in the frontend to implement web applications.
* Work in the WebUI backend to support web application service features.
* Develop reusable UI components in AngularJS, Angular2\\+, Javascript and HTML5/CSS3\\.
* Ensure that the Netskope web interface works seamlessly in all browsers.

Why CGBU Reimaging communications to connect the world.


Gone are the days where telecommunications were synonymous with pure networking protocols. In the world of tech, disruption is the name of the game. Driven by 5G, IoT, analytics and cloud technologies, this disruption is happening at the core of the telecom network, impacting the way we communicate, work, study and consume entertainment services. And it is not just at the network level. 5G, edge, IoT, AI/ML, analytics and cloud technologies are the underlying fabric of an entire ecosystem of fully connected intelligent sensors and devices, capable of overhauling economic and business policies, and further blurring geographical and cultural borders. When these technologies come together, they can deliver at every rung of the ecosystem‚Äôs ladder, and spark innovations that will have a profound impact on social and lifestyle shifts, which affect the way we do business and drive the next generation of technological development.

Why CGBU Reimaging communications to connect the world.


Gone are the days where telecommunications were synonymous with pure networking protocols. In the world of tech, disruption is the name of the game. Driven by 5G, IoT, analytics and cloud technologies, this disruption is happening at the core of the telecom network, impacting the way we communicate, work, study and consume entertainment services.
