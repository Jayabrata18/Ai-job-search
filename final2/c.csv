We are a seed funded SaaS startup helping e-commerce brands on Shopify move away from boring, impersonal marketing emails and sell on chat apps like FB Messenger & Whatsapp.

Within a year of launch, we have 1200+ e-commerce brands across 50+ countries using our product (pretty cool right?).

Check us out here - https://apps.shopify.com/bitespeed-fb-messenger-chatbot and do read through the 150 odd 5-star reviews to get a sense of what our customers say about us (we openly brag about this 😉).

About Us - We are a bunch of BITS Pilani graduates that started BiteSpeed out of our dorm rooms. When we started we hardly knew much about running a company, in fact most of us hadn’t written a line of code in our lives.

We were inspired by companies like Postman and Freshworks which have built market leading software companies from India and had a desire to create something world-class which we could be proud of.

So we jumped off the cliff and built a parachute on our way down (just as Reid Hoffman likes to say).

We could make a long, boring list of 20 company values but by now you probably do get a gist of the kind of people we are. We are young, ambitious self-learners on a journey to create a globally competitive software company from India.

About the role - We’re looking for a full-stack developer to join our founding team and lead our product development. If you’re someone who thrives on high ownership, can figure stuff out on your own and wants to be part of the zero-to-one journey, this might be for you.

What you’ll do:-

Tl;dr, we’re at 100k requests per day, you’ll take us to 10M requests per day.

As we’re still early at building a dedicated backend team, responsibilities will have breadth over a lot of cool stuff 🙌
• Looking out for cool new technologies and implementing them for required internal as well as business use cases
• Designing scalable architectures for backend systems
• Optimizing performance of applications for full scale production deployments
• Implementing business logic and developing APIs and services.
• Conceptualizing and implementing scalable databases across various services
• You’ll be hiring and mentoring junior developers

What makes you a good fit:-
• If you can write code that works, we should be good but read on (disclaimer: most of what follows is not a hard requirement);
• You have 2+ years of experience building and scaling backend systems from scratch;
• You've built serverless backend architectures using AWS platform and resources like Lambda, DynamoDB, Aurora, etc. (Brownie points if you’ve worked with NodeJS,Redis and Postgres);
• You have managed deployment at scale using CI/CD integrations and implemented error management systems like Sentry;
• Most of the above is us trying to sound legit about our stack, so if you’ve not worked with some of it & are open to learning or have better ideas, it’s totally cool;
• Be ready to jam to this every time we push to prod - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9QNUcrjtOs;

If what we’re up to sounds interesting, do apply!

Know someone who might be a great fit? Refer them to us, if they end up joining and complete 3 months with us, we'll send you an Amazon Echo Dot as a gesture of thanks!

Help us design and build more awesome eCommerce platforms.

We're the tiny team behind open-source projects like Sapper Commerce, commercial products like Litekart. We're hiring another programmer to help us build more awesome features and UI for the eCommerce platform.

About The Job

We're looking for someone to work closely with Swadesh (that's me, the guy who created Litekart!) to help shape and build the future of our tools and products.

You'd spend your time developing and improving existing projects, for example:

Integrate new e-commerce web designs

Building new components and pages

Implementing a componentization strategy for our Litekart templates to extract repeated patterns and make our existing components easier to maintain and faster to develop
• as well as contributing directly at the product strategy and creative level to new projects, such as:

Designing and developing learning management platform, hospital management, garage management

Planning and developing a new SaaS eCommerce

Building a live interactive demo application using Litekart to help potential customers see what's possible

Adding support for multiple themes to Litekart

We'd also do a ton of open-source work together, like:

Working on new Litekart features like dark mode support or animations

We're Only Four People (you'd Be Number Five) Which Means That Even Though We Each Have Our Areas Of Expertise, We All Wear Many Hats. We're Looking For a Programmer, But You'd Also Help Out With Things Like

Managing GitHub issues and fixing bugs

Writing and improving the documentation for the tools we make

Writing test cases for the frontend as well as back

Answering customer support questions

Troubleshooting problems for users in places like Twitter and Discord

If you've ever maintained an open-source project, working with us carries a lot of the same responsibilities.

Here are a few recent projects you might have worked on if you were already part of the team:

About You

We're looking for someone with very strong front-end skills who is an expert in Javascript, with experience in a back-end framework like NodeJS. More important than specific technical skills though is that you're a strong problem solver who loves to learn — we're not experts in everything and we don't expect you to be either.

You might not call yourself a designer, but you know great UI design when you see it and you know when something isn't up to par. Details matter to you, and if the text in a button is off-center by a pixel you will go to the end of the earth to figure out why.

We don't care if you went to school (I dropped out of both university and college!), we just care about what you can do and how you do it. We're all just makers and tinkerers, so as long as you love to build awesome stuff you'll fit right in.

Here are some of the technologies we work with day-to-day right now:

NodeJS, MongoDB, Svelte, React, Vue, TailwindCSS, Flutter

Pay And Benefits

This is a full-time (50-hour per week) position, and you can choose your own hours. All we ask is that you plan to overlap around ~4 hours per day with 7am-9pm IST because I am sick of always programming by myself.

The salary for this position is between 4,00,000 — 9,00,000 INR based on experience.

We are not interested in tracking time but just to guide you on the right track you will be tracking for the initial few days.

We are committed to working at a sustainable and healthy pace, and we believe 9-10 hours is more than enough time to get a solid day's work done.

How To Apply

To apply, write something specifically for this position that tells us why we're a great fit for each other, and what you see the future being like if we work together. Tell us what you're excited about in the industry these days, and what you're betting on for the future. Is there a project or feature you'd love for us to build together? Tell us about that too!

We don't ask for your resume but that doesn't mean we're not interested in what you've worked on in the past, we're just leaving it up to you to tell your own story the way you want to tell it.

We understand that not everyone has the same amount of time to dedicate to their application (I work from home with a four-year-old!), so don't feel like you need to spend 12 hours on it to stand out. As long as you sound like someone who could be a great fit when we're actually working together day-to-day with the same time constraints, we really want to meet you.

Give us a link to whatever you put together in the ""Your application"" field when applying.

We're accepting applications until Aug 15, 2022 at 10pm IST. There are no bonuses or penalties for submitting early or close to the deadline, so submit your application whenever works best for your own schedule. We're planning to start interviews early Aug, and aiming for a start date of mid Aug.

\\#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
We Are Cisco!

**About Sitetracker**

Sitetracker was founded ten years ago with the singular focus of solving a problem that was first recognized within the telecommunications industry; how to effectively manage the volume, variety, and velocity of critical infrastructure projects needed to meet the demand of expanding wireless and cellular service. That problem has become even more pronounced due to the eventual explosion of 5G. Being able to effectively deploy infrastructure is going to be the differentiator between leading telecommunication providers.

However, over the years, we realized that this challenge isn’t localized to telecommunications – it’s pervasive nearly everywhere and has reached an inflection point. Utilities (such as gas and electric services), smart cities, and alternative energy all face similar challenges. Sitetracker is the only full\\-lifecycle project management platform suited to support these companies and address these challenges.

We are exceptionally proud of the company we’ve built (we were recently recognized as the \\#2 place to work in San Francisco, as well as one of the top places to work in the entire United States). Our people are extraordinary and we’re continuing to invest in our people\\-first culture.","","https://in.indeed.com/cmp/Sitetracker","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/3cd59b0de818d90e47a19065a04cab78","http://www.sitetraker.com","Palo Alto","11 to 50","",""

About thinkbridge

thinkbridge is how growth\\-stage companies can finally turn into tech disruptors. They get a new way there – with world\\-class technology strategy, development, maintenance, and data science all in one place. But solving technology problems like these involves a lot more than code. That’s why we encourage think’ers to spend 80% of their time thinking through solutions and 20% coding them. With an average client tenure of 4\\+ years, you won’t be hopping from project to project here – unless you want to. So, you really can get to know your clients and understand their challenges on a deeper level. At thinkbridge, you can expand your knowledge during work hours specifically reserved for learning. Or even transition to a completely different role in the organization. It’s all about challenging yourself while you challenge small thinking.

thinkbridge is a place where you can:

* Think bigger – because you have the time, opportunity, and support it takes to dig deeper and tackle larger issues.
* Move faster – because you’ll be working with experienced, helpful teams who can guide you through challenges, quickly resolve issues, and show you new ways to get things done.
* Go further – because you have the opportunity to grow professionally, add new skills, and take on new responsibilities in an organization that takes a long\\-term view of every relationship.

thinkbridge…there’s a new way there. ™
